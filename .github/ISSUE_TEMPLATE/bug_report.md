Share with me your stats html file. It does not contain your source code - it is completely safe. You can send it to my email (see my github profile).

If you cannot provide me stats html file, provide **all** of this:

- [ ] Provide your rollup config (this is most important, because some plugins changes paths to files)
- [ ] Provide your node and dependencies versions
- [ ] Your OS type and version
- [ ] Screenshot of problem

If you do not follow template, issue will be closed without comment.
